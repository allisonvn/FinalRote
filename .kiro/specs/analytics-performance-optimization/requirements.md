# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical performance issues in the analytics system that are causing excessive API calls, repeated calculations, and poor user experience. The system currently performs redundant metric calculations, has inefficient real-time subscriptions, and lacks proper error handling for experiment operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the analytics to load efficiently without excessive API calls, so that the interface is responsive and doesn't overwhelm the server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL calculate metrics for each experiment only once per data refresh cycle
2. WHEN real-time data updates occur THEN the system SHALL debounce metric calculations to prevent excessive processing
3. WHEN analytics stats are refreshed THEN the system SHALL cache results for a minimum of 5 seconds to prevent redundant calculations
4. WHEN multiple components request the same experiment metrics THEN the system SHALL return cached data instead of recalculating

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling for experiment operations, so that 404 errors don't cause repeated failed requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an experiment is not found (404 error) THEN the system SHALL remove it from the local state and stop further requests
2. WHEN experiment update/delete operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error once and prevent repeated identical requests
4. IF an experiment returns 404 THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the experiment no longer exists

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want real-time updates to be efficient and not cause performance degradation, so that I can monitor experiments without system slowdown.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time subscriptions trigger THEN the system SHALL batch updates and process them at most once every 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple subscription events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL merge them into a single update operation
3. WHEN analytics metrics are recalculated THEN the system SHALL only update metrics for experiments that have new data
4. WHEN the dashboard is not visible THEN the system SHALL pause real-time updates to conserve resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized data fetching patterns, so that the system scales efficiently with more experiments and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching experiment metrics THEN the system SHALL use batch API calls instead of individual requests per experiment
2. WHEN loading dashboard data THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for experiments with more than 20 items
3. WHEN calculating analytics THEN the system SHALL use database-level aggregations instead of client-side calculations where possible
4. WHEN experiment data hasn't changed THEN the system SHALL use ETags or timestamps to avoid unnecessary data transfers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want clear loading states and error feedback, so that I understand when the system is working and when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are being calculated THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of console-only logging
3. WHEN real-time updates are paused THEN the system SHALL indicate the connection status to the user
4. WHEN data is stale THEN the system SHALL show the last update timestamp and provide a manual refresh option
